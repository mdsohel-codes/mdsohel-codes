Hi, I’m Md Sohel

### Web Development Intern (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

I’m a self-taught web development learner from West Bengal with a strong focus on building clean, responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am actively practicing web development by building small projects, improving layouts, responsiveness, and basic interactivity, and maintaining my work on GitHub.

Currently focusing on:

- HTML, CSS fundamentals and responsive design

- JavaScript basics (DOM manipulation, events)

- Version control using Git and GitHub

My goals:

- Gain real-world experience through a web development internship

- Learn industry practices by working on real tasks

Strengthen my front-end fundamentals and grow as a web developer
